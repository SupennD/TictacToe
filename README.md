# Assignment 1 - Tic Tac Toe (OOP & FP)

This project is part of my coursework assignment where I built two versions of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game:

- **OOP version** (`oop.html`) — built with object-oriented programming.
- **FP version** (`fp.html`) — built with functional programming.

Both games are browser-based and have the following features:
- Identical user interface and behavior
- Displays current player's turn or winner
- Restart button to start a new game
- Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries)

✅ **Requirement for course exam approval.**

---

**How to run:**
- Download the repository or clone it.
- Open either `oop.html` or `fp.html` in your web browser and start playing!
